# Camera transition effect textures
I think the original idea of the camera transition effect was from here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnAoD7hgDxw (the shader is pretty different though, and is created with shader graph)
Nonetheless, the texture files for the transitions were definitely from the package of that tutorial (Thus belongs to their creator, and are not under MIT license).
